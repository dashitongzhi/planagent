| Signal | What MingJian Delivers |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence first | Every recommendation is grounded in collected sources, extracted claims, and replayable traces. |
| Debate, not monologue | Specialized agents challenge assumptions before the system returns a recommendation. |
| Local sovereignty | Community runs locally with open-source code, local data control, and a 24-hour monitoring window. |
| Decision memory | Sessions, recommendation versions, refreshes, source health, and user outcomes stay connected. |

## Product Read

MingJian is built for people who need to make consequential decisions under uncertainty: founders, analysts, operators, researchers, strategists, and teams that need evidence they can inspect instead of answers they have to blindly trust.

The product experience is closer to a strategic intelligence cockpit than a chat box. A user submits a decision-support request; MingJian gathers evidence, runs analysis and simulation, convenes a debate council, returns a first recommendation, then keeps a versioned record that can be refreshed when source material changes.

---

## Edition Boundary

| Edition | Distribution | Core Workflow | Commercial Layer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Community** | Apache 2.0 self-hosted upstream | Full public decision workflow with 24-hour local monitoring | None |
| **Cloud** | Hosted SaaS subscription | Superset of Community public core | Subscription, metering, tenant operations |
| **Enterprise** | Private / on-prem deployment | Superset of Community public core | License, audit, governance, private connectors |

This repository is the **Community** edition. It must remain a strong open-source core: no Cloud subscription surfaces, no Enterprise-only governance code, and no proprietary mobile entry point unless explicitly published later.

Community monitoring is intentionally capped at a **24-hour local window**. Long-running 7x24 monitoring belongs to Cloud or Enterprise and is not included in this repository.

## Decision Workflow

```text
Question
  -> source discovery
  -> evidence extraction
  -> analysis and simulation
  -> role-based debate
  -> recommendation
  -> version timeline
  -> scheduled / source-change refresh
  -> decision record and outcome feedback
```

| Stage | Purpose | User-Visible Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gather | Collect multi-source evidence from news, code, social, and public data feeds. | Source list, cursor health, last checked time. |
| Reason | Convert evidence into arguments, risks, simulations, and structured claims. | Analysis artifacts, report sections, debate rounds. |
| Debate | Let role-based agents critique, revise, and arbitrate the decision. | Support/challenge/arbiter traces. |
| Remember | Persist sessions, recommendation versions, refresh triggers, and outcomes. | Timeline, recommendation history, feedback records. |

---

## What Makes It Different

| Old AI Analysis | MingJian |
| --- | --- |
| One answer, little context. | Evidence chain, debate trail, and recommendation versions. |
| Single-model blind spots. | Multi-agent critique with support, challenge, and arbitration roles. |
| Static responses. | Scheduled refresh and source-change triggered updates. |
| Hard to audit. | Deterministic traces, source attribution, and decision records. |
| Generic workflow. | Strategy, risk, market, policy, technical, social, and security perspectives. |

## 🔬 Core Features

### 1. Evidence-Driven, Not Guess-Driven

**The Problem:** Traditional AI tools give you answers without showing their work.

**Our Solution:** 明鉴 grounds every decision in **real-world evidence** from 10+ data sources. Every claim is traceable, every decision is auditable.

### 2. Multi-Agent Debate Protocol

**The Problem:** Single AI models have blind spots and biases.

**Our Solution:** Multiple AI models (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok) **debate** your decisions, challenging assumptions and reaching evidence-backed conclusions.

### 3. Dual-Domain Expertise

**The Problem:** Most AI tools are generic and don't understand your specific domain.

**Our Solution:** 明鉴 supports both **Corporate** (market analysis, competitive intelligence) and **Military** (operational planning, logistics) with domain-specific rules and models.

### 4. Full Auditability with Decision Traces

**The Problem:** You can't explain how AI reached a conclusion.

**Our Solution:** Every simulation produces a **deterministic decision trace** — a step-by-step record of how the AI reached its conclusion. No black boxes.

### 5. Jarvis Self-Repair Engine

**The Problem:** AI outputs can be wrong, but you don't know until it's too late.

**Our Solution:** 明鉴 reviews its own outputs, identifies weaknesses, and iterates until quality thresholds are met — all without human intervention.

### 6. Real-Time Streaming Analysis

**The Problem:** You wait for AI to finish, then get a black-box result.

**Our Solution:** Submit an analysis request and watch the AI work in real-time — streaming progress events, source attribution, and intermediate results.

### 7. 9-Agent Decision Council

**The Problem:** Single AI models have blind spots and biases.

**Our Solution:** 明鉴 deploys **9 specialized AI agents** — each with a distinct role, perspective, and model — to form a decision council:

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| 🟢 **Strategic Advocate** | Core | Argues FOR, finds supporting evidence |
| 🔴 **Risk Challenger** | Core | Argues AGAINST, finds counter-evidence |
| ⚖️ **Chief Arbitrator** | Core | Delivers final verdict based on evidence |
| 🔍 **Intelligence Analyst** | Perspective | Assesses evidence quality |
| 🌍 **Geopolitical Expert** | Perspective | Geopolitical analysis |
| 💰 **Economic Analyst** | Perspective | Economic/market analysis |
| ⚔️ **Military Strategist** | Perspective | Military/security analysis |
| 🔮 **Tech Forecaster** | Perspective | Technology trend analysis |
| 👥 **Social Impact Assessor** | Perspective | Social/public opinion analysis |

Inspired by **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture: core agents are always active, perspective agents are activated as needed — sparse activation at the software layer.

## 🧭 明鉴 的定位：AI 决策参谋

> **不是通用工具，而是专属参谋团。**

AI Agent 时代已经到来。编排层（Orchestrator）协调多个子 Agent 和工具，在沙箱环境中自主完成复杂任务 — 这已经被证明是有效的范式。

明鉴在此基础上更进一步，专注于**决策智能**：

### 设计理念

| 设计原则 | 明鉴的实践 |
|---------|-----------|
| 编排层 > 底层模型 | 9智能体注册中心，按角色分配模型 |
| 实时流式展示建立信任 | 辩论逐轮渲染，用户看到每一步推理 |
| 多工具协同完成任务 | 12个数据源 + 辩论引擎 + 仿真引擎 |
| 动态重规划应对失败 | 辩论失败时自动调整策略重新论证 |

### 核心差异化

| 维度 | 明鉴 |
|------|------|
| **目标** | 做出更好的决策 |
| **推理方式** | 9个智能体独立论证、交叉质询、仲裁裁决 |
| **证据基础** | 12个数据源结构化采集 → 证据提取 → 知识图谱 |
| **持续性** | WatchRule 持续监控 + 定时更新 + 突发事件检测 |
| **领域深度** | 企业/军事双领域仿真，KPI 追踪，场景分支 |
| **透明度** | 展示推理过程 + 用户可投票质疑 |
| **数据主权** | 自部署，数据完全在本地 |
| **成本** | 自有模型，边际成本趋近于零 |

### MoE 架构思想

明鉴的 9 智能体系统借鉴了 **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** 的核心思想：

```
用户问题 → 路由器（辩论流程）→ 选择专家组合 → 独立推理 → 加权裁决
```

就像 DeepSeek-V3 用 256 个专家中只激活少数最相关的，明鉴在 9 个智能体中根据问题类型选择最合适的组合。核心 3 角色（支持方/挑战方/仲裁官）始终激活，视角 6 角色按需参与 — 这就是软件层的稀疏激活。

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Click Docker Setup

The fastest way to run 明鉴 locally is the Docker setup script. It checks Docker, creates `.env` from `.env.example`, asks for your OpenAI API key, and starts the full stack.

#### Prerequisites

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) first, then run:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

When the script finishes, open:

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3001 |
| API | http://localhost:8000 |
| MinIO Console | http://localhost:9001 |

MinIO login: use `PLANAGENT_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` / `PLANAGENT_MINIO_SECRET_KEY` from your `.env`.

To stop the Docker stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

### Manual Development Setup

Use this path if you want to run the backend and frontend directly on your machine for development.

#### Frontend Directory Policy

`frontend-v2/` is the active Vite frontend. The older `frontend/` and `frontend-new/` experiments have been retired, so new product UI, builds, and Docker development should target `frontend-v2/`.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Version | Installation |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Python** | 3.12+ | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Node.js** | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **npm** | 9+ | Comes with Node.js |
| **Git** | 2.30+ | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| **PostgreSQL** | 14+ (optional) | [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) |
| **Redis** | 7+ (optional) | [redis.io](https://redis.io/download) |

#### System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4+ cores |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 8+ GB |
| **Storage** | 10 GB | 50+ GB |
| **OS** | macOS, Linux, Windows | macOS or Linux |

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# AI Model Configuration
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# You only need ONE API key to get started.
# The system automatically uses the same key for all 7 model slots
# (primary, extraction, x_search, report, debate_advocate,
#  debate_challenger, debate_arbitrator) unless you override them.

PLANAGENT_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Override individual targets (all fall back to shared if unset).
# Set the API key first, run the provider connection test to fetch available models,
# then paste one of the returned model IDs if you need a manual override.
# PLANAGENT_OPENAI_PRIMARY_MODEL=
# PLANAGENT_OPENAI_PRIMARY_API_KEY=sk-...
# PLANAGENT_OPENAI_EXTRACTION_MODEL=
# PLANAGENT_OPENAI_DEBATE_ADVOCATE_MODEL=
# PLANAGENT_OPENAI_DEBATE_CHALLENGER_MODEL=
# PLANAGENT_OPENAI_DEBATE_ARBITRATOR_MODEL=

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Database (optional — defaults to SQLite for local dev)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PLANAGENT_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://planagent:planagent@localhost:5432/planagent

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Redis (optional — for event bus in production)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PLANAGENT_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# MinIO Object Storage (optional)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PLANAGENT_MINIO_ENDPOINT=localhost:9000
# PLANAGENT_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
# PLANAGENT_MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# X / Twitter (optional — for social intelligence)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# X_BEARER_TOKEN=your_x_bearer_token

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Frontend
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api
```

> **💡 Key Point:** Even if you only have access to **one** model provider (e.g., OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible API), you can use it for all 7 model slots. Just set `PLANAGENT_OPENAI_API_KEY` — the system fills in the rest automatically. No need for 4 different API keys to get started.

#### Compatible Providers

All slots use the OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint. You can mix and match providers freely:

| Provider | Base URL |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | **`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/openai`** |
| DeepSeek | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` |
| Google Gemini | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` |
| xAI Grok | `https://api.x.ai/v1` |
| Xiaomi MiMo | `https://token-plan-cn.xiaomimimo.com/v1` |
| Zhipu GLM | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` |
| MiniMax | `https://api.minimax.chat/v1` |
| Any compatible proxy | Your proxy URL |

#### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dashitongzhi/MingJian.git
cd planagent

# 2. Create and activate Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 4. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend-v2
npm install
cd ..

# 5. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your API keys and settings

# 6. Initialize database (if using PostgreSQL)
# Create database named 'planagent'
# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 7. Start backend server
uvicorn planagent.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# 8. Start frontend (in a new terminal)
cd frontend-v2
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Community local mode is loopback-only and uses a deployment-local single-user session. Do not
bind the API to `0.0.0.0` or another non-loopback address unless
`PLANAGENT_REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED=true` and a persistent
`PLANAGENT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` of at least 32 bytes are configured. Remote self-registration is
always disabled in Community; remote mode exposes only the bootstrap `admin` login. `setup.sh`
stores the initial administrator password in
`PLANAGENT_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` inside the local `.env`; rotate it after the first remote
administrator login through `POST /auth/change-password`, then update the local `.env` copy.

#### Worker Commands

The Docker Compose stack starts the configured workers automatically. For a manual installation,
list the available worker IDs and run only the workers needed by the local deployment:

```bash
planagent-worker list
planagent-worker ingest-worker --loop
planagent-worker strategic-watch-worker --loop
```

Each worker records terminal failures in the dead-letter table. Stream-backed workers also reclaim
stale pending events and retry them up to the configured `PLANAGENT_WORKER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` limit.

PDF export is included in the default Python installation through WeasyPrint. Report Markdown is
treated as untrusted input during PDF rendering: external `http(s)`, `file`, and other resource
fetches are disabled. Embed approved images as `data:` URLs when a self-contained PDF needs them.
Inline resources are restricted to approved image MIME types, 5 MiB per image, and 16 images per
report; Markdown input is capped at 500,000 characters.
The Docker image already includes WeasyPrint's native Pango/Cairo libraries; manual installations
must provide the equivalent native libraries for their operating system.
